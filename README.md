# ProtienGenerator
  - <a href="https://github.com/Doobss/ProtienGenerator" >**Protien Generator/Visulizer**</a>: This is a project that generates random strings of "DNA" and then breaks them down into their constituent amino acids. Once we have the amino acid sequence it then generates a vector array image of the protien to be rendered by plotly on the front end. The "DNA" is generated, split and reassembled using **PyTorch**, the data is then served using **Flask** and rendered by **React**.
